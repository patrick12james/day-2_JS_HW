// JavaScript Callback Function
/*
    Simply put: A Callback is a function that is to be executed after another
    function has finished its execution - hence the name callback.
    More Complex Definition: In JavaScript, functions are objects. Because of this,
    functions can take other functions as arguments(parameters), and can return functions
    by other functions.
    Functions that do this are called "higher - Order functions". Any function,
    that is passed as an argument is called a "Callback function".
    SOOOO...why do we need them?
    The reason for this is, because of the JavaScript Event Loop. In a nutshell
    JavaScript is an event driven language so this means, that instead of waiting for
    a response before moving on, JS will keep executing while listening for other events.

// Basic Callback with the DOM and button

let myButton = document.getElementById('btn');
console.log(myButton);

function buttonClicked(){
    console.log("The button has been clicked!")
}

myButton.addEventListener('click', buttonClicked);
